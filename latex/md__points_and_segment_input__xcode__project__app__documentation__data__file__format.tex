This preliminary version of the documentation exclusively deals with Point and Segment objects This data format is unshamedly inspired by the OBJ file format.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Comments Everything following a \# sign is a comment. Blank lines are skipped.
\item Wod Bounds The file starts with 4 lines specifying the bounds of the world\+: the min and max values of the world coordinates. Format\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

XMIN = -\/5 XMAX = 7 YMIN = -\/2 YMAX = 3.\+5

The space characters around the = sign are (at this point) part of the format. Note that specifying extremely different dimensions along the x and y directions may result the app setting in silly proportions to its window, or rejecting the input file outright.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item List of Points The file continues with a list of points defined by their coordinates, one point per line. The line starts by either the letter \char`\"{}p\char`\"{} or the letter \char`\"{}v\char`\"{} (I am not fully committed on the \char`\"{}point\char`\"{} vs. \char`\"{}vertex\char`\"{} choice), followed one or more blank characters, then by the x and y cordinates of the point, separated by one or more blank characters. For example\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

v 3.\+4 12.\+5 p 6.\+1 8.\+2

These points will be listed in the Point class\textquotesingle{}s master Point list, with an index starting at 0.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item List of Segments ~\newline
 Next in the file is a list of segments defined by the indices of their endpoints, one segment per line. The line starts with the letter \char`\"{}s\char`\"{}, followed one or more blank characters, then by indices of the segment\textquotesingle{}s two endpoints, separated by one or more blank characters. For example\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
